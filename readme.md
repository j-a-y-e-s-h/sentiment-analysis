# Sentiment Analysis Project 📊💬

Welcome to my sentiment analysis project! This project analyzes the sentiment of text using machine learning techniques and natural language processing. We'll walk you through the process step by step.

## Overview 🌟

Sentiment analysis is the process of determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text. In this project, we utilize a variety of tools and techniques to analyze sentiments, from data collection to model evaluation.

## Steps Involved 🛠️

### 1. Data Collection

We collect text data from a file for analysis.

### 2. Data Pre-processing and Labeling

Text data undergoes pre-processing, including lowercasing, punctuation removal, and labeling with sentiment.

### 3. Feature Extraction

We use TF-IDF vectorization to extract features from the text data.

### 4. Model Selection and Training

A Support Vector Machine (SVM) model is selected and trained using the labeled data.

### 5. Model Evaluation and Prediction

The trained model is evaluated using test data, and predictions are made.

## Sentiment Analysis Function 📝

We provide a function to analyze the sentiment of any text input. It utilizes the VADER sentiment analysis tool.

## Overall Sentiment Analysis 📈

We determine the overall sentiment of the text and display it.

## Emotion Distribution Plot 📊

A bar plot is generated to visualize the distribution of emotions in the analyzed text.
